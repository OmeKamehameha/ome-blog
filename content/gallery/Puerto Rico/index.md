We Stayed in Puerto Rico from July 1st 2021 till July 30 2021, visited El Yunque national park and a few other touristy things.

The Airbnb we got was in Rio Piedras which could be 'ok' or 'not ok at all' luckily we landed on the better side of that neighborhood, overall really enjoyed my stay here.

Some of the things we learned in PR:

-You can rent a moving van cheaper than you can rent a compact car.

-Lechon with arroz con gandules - heaven is real and it tastes like crispy smoky pork.

-Panaderias here sell more than just bread.

-Plantains are in every-thing.

-Mamposteao con Churrasco is in every restaurant and amazing everywhere.

-Theres million ways to make a mojito most are delicious all will put you on your ass.

-Driving on the island is crazy either its an old man dong 40 in a 65 in and out of traffic or the Fast and Furious Fan that is undefeated on the streets.

-Get to Culebra, its worth it.
