Gunnar is one half of the deadly duo Gunnar and Charlotte, they love nothing more than to run around chasing birds and each other.

He was born on October 29, 2019, he is a solid liver brown with only a sliver of white fur on his neck he was purchased when he was 3 months old from an ad on Craigslist it read "Weimerainer mix puppies $100". The owner threw in his sister Charlotte for only $50 more.

Theve are inseparable to this day.
